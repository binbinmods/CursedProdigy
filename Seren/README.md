# Seren, the Cursed Prodigy

A hero mod, introducing Seren, a Cursed Mage who excels at casting Large, Powerful spells.

This currently does not include any events or quests related to Seren other than those available to all heroes or all heroes of a specific class.

### Known Bugs
- The damage description always appears as if the card is empowered, even if the card would not be

A couple of notes:
## Notes:
- I understand that things are going to be janky at times, and there are definitely bugs that will be worked out
- **What to do if Seren is not unlocked:** Due to some jankiness of the way the code works, Seren is unlocked only for the profile that is open when you launch the game (and for new profiles). So if they aren't unlocked in the correct profile, switch to that profile, close the game and re-open it and they will be unlocked. I'll fix this in the future, but most people won't notice it. You can also just use the profile editor to fix it.
- There are **no character events** for Seren at this time beyond the ones that are available to all characters of a given class (such as pet trainers or healers being able to remove cards at Rest areas).
- Seren's selection location (in the Hero Selection screen) is intentionally in position 5 (the far right). I have not yet automated the process of placing characters, and this is to accommodate other heroes. If you wish to change this, you can access the `cursedprodigy.json` file and the `OrderInList` property with whatever you wish.

## Installation (manual)

1. Install [Obeliskial Essentials](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Essentials/) and [Obeliskial Content](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Content/).

3. In Steam, right-click Across the Obelisk and select _Manage_->_Browse local files_.
4. Extract the archive into the game folder. Your _Across the Obelisk_ folder should now contain a `BepInEx` folder and a `doorstop\libs` folder.
